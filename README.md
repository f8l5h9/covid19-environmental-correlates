## Abstract

The novel SARS-CoV2 has disrupted health systems and the economy, and
public health interventions to slow its spread have been costly. How and
when to ease restrictions to movement hinges in part on whether
SARS-CoV2 will display seasonality due to variations in temperature,
humidity, and hours of sunshine. Here, we address this question by means
of a spatio-temporal analysis in Spain of the incidence of COVID-19, the
disease caused by the virus. Use of spatial Seemingly Unrelated
Regressions (SUR) allows us to model the incidence of reported cases of
the disease per 100,000 population as an interregional contagion
process, in addition to a function of temperature, humidity, and
sunshine. In the analysis we also control for GDP per capita, percentage
of older adults in the population, population density, and presence of
mass transit systems. The results support the hypothesis that incidence
of the disease is lower at higher temperatures and higher levels of
humidity. Sunshine, in contrast, displays a positive association with
incidence of the disease. Our control variables also yield interesting
insights. Higher incidence is associated with higher GDP per capita and
presence of mass transit systems in the province; in contrast,
population density and percentage of older adults display negative
associations with incidence of COVID-19.

# Introduction

From a small outbreak linked to a live animal market at the end of 2019
to a global pandemic in a matter of weeks, the SARS-CoV2 virus and
COVID-19, the disease it causes, have threatened to overrun health
systems around the world. In efforts to contain the spread of the
disease, numerous governments in many regions and nations have either
recommended or mandated social distancing measures, and as of this
writing, millions of people in five continents shelter in place. There
are encouraging signs that these measures have mitigated the spread of
the virus (e.g., Lancastle 2020; Lewnard and Lo 2020; Wilder-Smith and
Freedman 2020). Even so, this has come at a high cost, and the
consequences for all spheres of economic, social, and cultural life have
been dire (e.g., Fernandes 2020; Luo and Tsang 2020). As a result, there
is a sense of urgency to anticipate the progression of the pandemic, in
order to plan for progressive lifting of restrictions to movement and
social contact (e.g., Kissler et al. 2020). Needless to say, this has
become a delicate, and politically charged, balancing act between public
health and the economy (Gong et al. 2020).

A salient question in the debate about how and when to ease social
distancing measures is whether the virus will display seasonal
variations. Existing research on similar pathogens suggests that the
virus could be more stable and potentially easier to transmit in
conditions of low temperature and low humidity. While this is
encouraging, it is important to keep in mind that “not all seasonal
respiratory viruses experience the same spatiotemporal patterns” (Ángel
Solá et al. 2020, sec. 4). This urges caution when extrapolating from
known viruses. The evidence in this respect is as yet inconclusive, and
although easing restrictions as the weather warms may appear tempting,
doing so prematurely could well undo weeks or possibly months of costly
measures.

It is not surprising, given the stakes involved, that this issue has
already triggered a lively debate. The current state of knowledge was
well-summarized by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine in the U.S. in a recent report (see National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering and Medicine 2020). Engaged by the Office of the
Executive for guidance on this matter, this organization concluded that:
“\[some\] limited data support a potential waning of cases in warmer and
more humid seasons, yet none are without major limitations…Additional
studies as the SARS-CoV2 pandemic unfolds could shed more light on the
effects of climate on transmission” (p. 6). To further complicate
matters, much of the relevant work has yet to be peer-reviewed (see for
instance the challenge of Harbert, Cunningham, and Tessler 2020; to
Araujo and Naimi 2020).

With the above considerations in mind, our objective with this paper is
to investigate the influence of environmental factors, concretely
temperature, humidity, and sunshine, on the progression of the pandemic.
We adopt a population health approach, and report results from a
spatio-temporal model of the incidence of COVID-19 in the coterminous
provinces in Spain, one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic. We
combine data on reported cases of the disease with metereological
information, to create a spatio-temporal dataset covering a period of 30
days. We then join this dataset with provincial-level economic and
demographic information to act as controls to our key environmental
variables. These data are analyzed using a spatial Seemingly Unrelated
Regressions (SUR) approach, which allows us to model incidence of
COVID-19 as a contagion process.

The results provide evidence of the effect of temperature, humidity, and
sunshine on the incidence of COVID-19. The clearest result with respect
to these variables is a lower incidence of COVID-19 at higher
temperatures and levels of humidity, while the opposite happens with
respect to hours of sunshine. Our control variables also provide some
intriguing insights. Higher incidence is associated with higher GDP per
capita and presence of mass transit systems in the province; in
contrast, population density and percentage of older adults display
negative associations with incidence of COVID-19. The results of this
analysis provide support to the hypothesis of seasonality of the novel
SARS-CoV2, and should be of interest to public health officials and
policy makers grappling with the question of the trajectory of the
pandemic.

# Background

The global emergence of infectious diseases is mostly driven by
environmental, ecological, and socio-economic factors (Jones et al.
2008). In the case of SARS-CoV2, the ecological factors include the
interaction between humans and wildlife. Once transmission of a disease
begins to happen between humans, socio-economic and environmental
factors become increasingly important. As noted in the introduction, the
focus of the paper is on environmental variables, concretely three
related to meteorological conditions: temperature, humidity, and
sunshine.

Much of what is known about the potential seasonality of SARS-CoV2 is a
result of research on other pathogens. Earlier, diverse studies have
shown the effect of temperature and humidity on the incidence of
influenza (e.g., Mäkainen et al. 2009; Jaakkola et al. 2014; Kudo et al.
2019). Jaakkola et al. (2014), for example, found that a decrease of
temperature and absolute humidity precedes the onset of symptoms of
influenza A and B viruses by 3 days in places where the temperature is
low. After the 2002-2004 outbreak of SARS, researchers also began to
investigate the relationship between these factors and SARS-CoV
(Casanova et al. 2010; Chan et al. 2011). Casanova et al. (2010), for
instance, used surrogates to find that virus inactivation was likely
more rapid at higher temperatures; in terms of humidity, these
researchers reported that survival of the virus was lower at moderate
relative humidity levels. Chan et al. (2011) also found that viability
of the virus that causes SARS is also lost at higher temperatures
(\>38°C) and relative humidity superior to 95%.

Whether results from laboratory experiments will hold when the virus
circulates in the community remains uncertain. At a global scale, de
Ángel Solá et al. (2020) see less risk from SARS-CoV2 in the Caribean
Basin; on the other hand, Coelho et al. (Coelho et al. 2020) warn that
at least during the exponential phase, expansion of the virus is not
driven by climate. Similarly, whereas Araujo and Naimi (2020) argue that
spread of SARS-CoV2 will likely be constrained by climate, Harbert et
al. (2020) remain unconvinced that spatial modelling can currently
discriminate the distribution of the disease on the basis of climate, at
least in the United States. Yao et al. (2020), examined data from China
and came to the conclusion that neither temperature nor ultraviolet
indices had an association with transmission of COVID-19. This is
despite previous research that has linked less exposure to UVB radiation
to higher prevalence and severity of acute respiratory tract infections
(Zittermann et al. 2016; Dąbrowska-Leonik et al. 2018; Dinlen et al.
2016; Mathyssen et al. 2017; Esposito and Lelii 2015; Jat 2017;
Moriyama, Hugentobler, and Iwasaki 2020).

In addition to the environmental variables above, from a population
health perspective it is also important to account for potential
socio-economic and demographic confounders.

To account for population-level factors, the first variable that we
consider is GDP per capita. Much has been written about globalization
and the spread of infectious disease. The growth in global connections
has presented a challenge to spatial approaches in the initial stages of
disease management, when the cause of a disease may still be unclear but
the plane has already departed (Zhou and Coleman 2016). In reference to
the earlier outbreak of SARS, van Wagner (2008) chronicles how Toronto’s
status as a global city turned out to be a vulnerability in this
respect. In our case, we think of GDP per capita as a marker of a
region’s relative position in a network of global cities, and its
potential to be further ahead in the trajectory of the pandemic.
Furthermore, wealthier regions also tend to concentrate more activities
that produce non-traded goods, including building and construction
(Hallet 2002). Therefore, it is possible that wealthier regions remain
relatively more active even during a lockdown. On the other hand, we
cannot discount the possibility that less wealthy regions have a higher
proportion of workers in manual occupations who cannot telework, and
therefore have more difficulties complying with shelter-in-place orders.

Secondly, we consider percentage of older adults (over 65) in a region.
Early evidence regarding COVID-19 suggests that the case rate mortality
is higher at older ages (e.g. The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency
Response Epidemiology Team 2020). However, it is not clear that a
relatively large population of older adults necessarily translates into
higher transmission rates of the infection. The tool of choice in
containing the spread of the disease has been social distancing. In this
respect, the evidence from the field of transportation is that older
adults tend to travel less frequently, for shorter distances, and have
higher rates of immobility than most everyone, except the youngest
members of the public (e.g., Roorda et al. 2010; Morency et al. 2011;
Sikder and Pinjari 2012). In other words, many older adults are, whether
by preference or otherwise, already in a form of social isolation.
Social distancing during the pandemic may actually reinforce that
condition for them, as suggested by the analysis of age-structured
social contact in India, China, and Italy of Sing and Adhikari (2020).
Since the age-structured matrix of social contact in Spain is similar to
Italy (see Prem, Cook, and Jit 2017), our expectation is that
populations with higher percentages of older adults will tend to have
lower levels of social contact and hence of incidence.

Population density is also relevant since it directly affects the
contact patterns and contact rates between individuals in a population
(Hu, Nigmatulina, and Eckhoff 2013). The evidence available suggests a
positive relationship between the transmission of COVID-19 and
population density (e.g. cumulative incidence in urban areas like NYC).
For this reason, we anticipate a positive relationship between
population density and the incidence of the disease.

The last variable that we consider as a control is the presence of mass
transit systems in a province. Every province in Spain offers some form
of public transportation, but only five provinces have higher order
systems of mass mobility (e.g. metro or subway), namely Barcelona,
Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia, and Bizkaia. Public transportation has been
hypothesized to relate to the spread of contagious disease by some
researchers using agent-based approaches and simulation (e.g., Perez and
Dragicevic 2009; Wang et al. 2010), and while we find scant evidence of
a link in the literature, the idea is intuitively appealing. After all,
unlike the isolation that a car offers to travellers, most mass transit
system are cauldrons of social contact.

# Context and Data

## Covid-19 in Spain

The first reported case of COVID-19 in Spain was on January 31st, 2020,
when a German tourist in the Canary Islands tested positive for the
virus. After this case, it was still a few weeks before the first
domestic case was reported, on February 27th in Sevilla province
(Andalusia). In a short period of time, as testing started to ramp up,
it became clear that an outbreak was flaring. By March 11th the World
Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 officially a pandemic. This
declaration marked a turning point for the public in Spain too. As of
March 13th, the number of cases of COVID-19 reported in Spain was 4,473,
with a majority of cases (1,990) concentrated in Madrid: these numbers
were at the time the worst outbreak in Europe after Italy. In response
to the situation, on March 13th the Spanish National Government declared
a state of emergency, to go into effect on Saturday March 14th. As part
of the state of emergency restrictions to most activities were imposed,
with the exception of essential services (e.g. food, health) and some
economic subsectors of industry and construction. A few days later, on
March 17th, Spain closed its lands borders to allow entry only to
returnee nationals and permanent residents. The lockdown was further
hardened between March 30th and April 12th (including the Easter weekend
of April 10th-12th) and during this period only essential activities
were allowed. During this period, there was a dramatic reduction in
overall mobility, both within provinces as between .

## Data

Our dataset includes information about the daily number of cases of
COVID-19 reported in Spain at the provincial level (NUTS3 in Eurostat
terminology) for the period between March 13th and April 11th,
inclusive. For our purposes, we consider positive cases reported, but
exclude symptomatic cases diagnosed by a doctor without a Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR) test. The Spanish National Government publishes
periodic updates at the regional level (NUTS2) and the information is
also released at the provincial level as part of a collaborative project
by geovoluntarios.com, ProvidencialData19, and ESRI España. This
information is compiled from several sources, mainly the official web
pages of the Spanish regional goverments, as documented in Centro de
Datos Covid-19. We consider two sets of explanatory variables. The first
one, and the focus of this research, are the three environmental
variables, collected from official sources (i.g., *AEMET*, the state
meteorology agency, and *MAPA*, the ministry of agriculture, fisheries,
and food). The second set provides some relevant controls as discussed
above, and are also collected from official sources, i.e., INE, the
national statistics institute. Table  shows the descriptive statistics
and the provenance of the data used in this research.

The spatial and temporal coverage of the data is as follows. Our dataset
begins on March 13, which is the first date when every province had
reported at least one case of COVID-19, and continues until April 11,
for a period of 30 days. The unit of analysis is the province. Provinces
are the equivalent of states, and are embedded in Autonomous
Communities. As an example, Cataluña is an Autonomous Community and
consists of four provinces, namely Barcelona, Gerona, Lerida, and
Tarragona. The size of the provinces is relatively large, as seen in
Table . The smallest province is \(1,978.12km^2\) (this is smaller than
Rhode Island in the U.S.) and the largest province is \(21,767.93km^2\)
(slightly smaller than New Jersey in the U.S.). While this is a
relatively large degree of spatial aggregation, reporting on COVID-19 is
not yet consistent at smaller geographies, or cases are not reported at
that level at all.

An important aspect of working with environmental data such as
temperature, humidity, and hours of sunshine, is the incubation period
of the disease. Lauer et al. (2020) report for the case of COVID-19 a
median incubation period of 5.7 days (with a confidence interval between
4.9 to 7.8 days). The vast majority of cases (95%) develop symptoms
between 2.6 days (CI, 2.1 to 3.7 days) and 12.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 17.7
days). For this reason, we judge it best to use lagged values of the
environmental variables. We test different time lags as follows. We
consider a lagged 8-day average, from date-minus-12 to date-minus-5 days
(hereafter *lag8*). Secondly, we consider a lagged 11-day average, from
date-minus-12 to date-minus-2 days (hereafter *lag11*). Finally, to
account for the likely duration of incubation, we consider a lagged
11-day *weighted* average, from date-minus-12 to date-minus-2 days
(hereafter *lag11w*). The weights for this variable are calculated using
the parameters of the log-normal distribution reported by Lauer et
al. (2020), i.e., a log-mean of 1.621 and a log-standard deviation of
0.418. With these weights, the environmental variables at date-minus-2
and date-minus-12 days are weighted as 0.041 and 0.009 respectively,
whereas the environmental variables at date-minus-5 days are weighted as
0.194. These weights have the effect of changing the contribution of
daily values to the lagged moving average. For instance, the temperature
at date-minus-4-days is weighted more heavily than the temperature at
date-minus-10-days, as a closer approximation of the conditions at the
most likely time of contagion before the disease became manifest.

# Methods: the Spatial SUR Model

The Seemingly Unrelated Regression equations model (SUR hereafter) is a
multivariate econometric model used in different fields when the
structure of the data consists of cross-sections for different time
periods. The basis of this approach is well-known since the initial
works of Zellner (1962), and has become a popular methodology included
in several econometrics textbook (e.g., Greene 2003). To our knowledge,
Anselin (1988) was the first author to discuss SUR from a spatial
perspective, in the context of spatio-temporal analysis. In his landmark
text, Anselin discussed a model made of “an equation for each time
period, which is estimated for a cross section of spatial units”
(p. 141). From this milestone, a large body of research has developed
to extend the classical SUR into a spatial framework (e.g., Rey and
Montouri 1999; Lauridsen et al. 2010; Le Gallo and Dall’Erba 2006;
López, Martínez-Ortiz, and Cegarra-Navarro 2017).

The classical SUR model without spatial effects (from here, SUR-SIM) is
a stack of equations as follows:

<!--
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sur-sim}
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_T
\end{bmatrix}
=
  \begin{bmatrix}
X_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & X_2 & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & X_T
\end{bmatrix}
\
\begin{bmatrix}
\beta_1 \\ \beta_1 \\ \vdots \\ \beta_T
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_1 \\ \epsilon_2 \\ \vdots \\ \epsilon_T
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $y_{t}=(y_{1t},...,y_{Nt})$ is a $N \times 1$ vector, and in our case $y_{st}$ is the incidence ratio in the province $s$ ($s=1,...,N$) the day $t$ $(t=1,...,T)$; $X_t$ is a $N \times k_t$ matrix of the $k_t$ independent variables, with associated vector of coefficients $\beta_t$,; $\beta_t=(\beta_{1t},...,\beta_{Nt})$ is a vector of coefficients and $\epsilon_t=(\epsilon_{1t},...,\epsilon_{Nt})$ is the vector of residuals.

is the vector of residuals.

A key feature of the SUR model is the temporal dependence structure
among the vectors of residuals, namely:

<!--

\label{eq:sur-err}
E[\epsilon_t \epsilon'_{t'}]=\sigma_{tt'}
\end{equation} 

Note that this specification is very flexible, in that it allows changes in the coefficients $\beta_{it}$ in order to modulate the effect of the independent variables on $y_t$. This flexibility can be reduced and it is posible to impose restrictions considering some $\beta$ coefficients as being constant over time. In this case, we can reformulate the coefficients expression $\beta_t = (\beta_{1}, \cdots, \beta_{r-1}, \beta_{r}, \beta_{r+1}, \cdots, \beta_{Nt})$ to restrict the first $r$ coefficients to be constant across equations. This is equivalent to specifying some effects to be invariant over time.

As is the case with cross-sectional data, it is possible to test the
residuals of Model () for spatial autocorrelation, and several tests
have been developed to test the null hypothesis of spatial independence
(see López, Mur, and Angulo 2014). When the null hypothesis is rejected,
several alternative specifications have been proposed to include spatial
effects (Anselin 1988, see also 2016). In this paper we consider a
spatial SUR model that incorporates a spatial lag of the dependent
variable as an explanatory factor. Spatial analytical approaches were
used to understand contagion-difussion processes in the case of
infectious disease in general (e.g., Cliff, Haggett, and Smallman-Raynor
1998) and the 2003-2004 SARS outbreak in particular (e.g., Meng et al.
2005; Cao et al. 2010). While we are mindful of the same caveat that the
novel SARS-CoV2 may not follow the patterns of previous diseases, there
is still evidence from the United States that COVID-19 displays spatial
patterns that are consistent with a diffusion process (Desjardins, Hohl,
and Delmelle 2020). For this reason, the spatial lag model is
appropriate to model incidence of COVID-19 geographically, since it
accounts for potential spatial patterns that result from a process of
contagion, as explained next.

The stack expresion for the SUR model with a spatially lagged dependent
variable (SUR-SLM) is as follows:

<!--
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sur-slm}
\begin{aligned}
\bf{AY} = \bf{X} \beta + \epsilon \\
\epsilon =N(0,\bf{\Sigma})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bf{A} =I_{TN}-\bf{\Gamma} \otimes W$ is the spatially lagged dependent variable, and $\bf{\Gamma} = diag(\rho_1, \cdots, \rho_T)$.

This specification assumes that outcome ($y_{st}$) at location $s$ and time $t$ is partially determined by the weighted average ($Wy_{st}$) of the outcome in neighboring provinces, with neighborhood defined by matrix $W$ of spatial weights. In other words, the spatially lagged dependent variable represents a process of contagion, where the disease in neighboring provinces can spillover in a spatial way. The coefficients of the spatially lagged variable are estimated for each time period $\rho_t$ and identify the intensity and the sign of the contagion effect. It is possible test the null hypothesis of identical levels of spatial dependence ($\rho_i=\rho_j, \forall i,j$). The correspond Wald test is available in the `R` package `spsur`.

The correspond Wald test is available in the `R` package `spsur`.

The SUR-SLM model can be estimated using maximum likelihood (López, Mur,
and Angulo (2014)) or instrumental variables (Mínguez, López, and Mur
(2019)).

A note regarding the interpretation of the model is in order. It is
well-known that coefficients in linear regression models are partial
derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to the independent
variables, and therefore directly give the marginal effects or rates of
change. Spatially lagged models, however, are no longer linear. The
intuition behind the non-linearity is that the spatial lag expands the
information set to include information from neighbouring regions: in
other words, the value of an explanatory variable in a spatial unit can
have influence in other spatial units via the spatial lag. This makes
interpretation of the coefficients less straightforward but also richer
(Golgher and Voss 2016). The results of LeSage (2009) for
cross-sectional spatial lag models can be extended to the spatial SUR
framework. Note that, according to Elhorst (2014), the partial
derivatives have the following interpretation: if an explanatory
variable (\(X_k\)) in a particular province changes, not only the
incidence rate in that province changes, also incidence rates in other
provinces change via the contagion effect. Therefore, a change in
\(X_k\) in a particular province has a *direct effect* on that province,
but also an *indirect effect* on neighbouring provinces. In this way,
the \(i\)th diagonal element of the matrix of partial derivatives
represents the direct effect on the \(i\)th province, whereas the
non-diagonal elements of \(i\)th row of the matrix of partial
derivatives represent the indirect effects on other provinces. In order
to obtain a global indicator, the direct effect is calculated as the
mean of the diagonal elements and captures the average change in
incidence ratio caused by the change in \(X_k\). Likewise, a global
indicator of the indirect effects is calculated as the mean of the
non-diagonal elements. The total effect is the sum of direct and
indirect effects. Finally, note that if \(\rho_k = 0\), the indirect
effects are 0 and the direct effects are equal to \(\beta_kt\).

# Results

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Figure  shows the geographical variation in the incidence of COVID-19 in
Spain, as well as the temporal progression of the disease in weekly
averages. Our analysis begins on March 13. Albeit still low, the highest
incidence at this early date was in the provice of Álava, in the North
of Spain. Álava is not the most populous province, with a population of
only 331,549, but it has the highest GDP per capita of all provinces.
Vitoria, its main city, is the capital of the Basque Country and has
been the focus of efforts, along with San Sebastian and Bilbao, to
develop a “Global Basque City” (Meijers, Hoekstra, and Aguado 2008). The
other early focus of the pandemic in Spain was Madrid, which is the most
populous province in the country and has the second highest GDP per
capita after Álava. The early outbreaks in these two provinces can be
traced throughout the progression of the pandemic over time, although by
the end of the period under study, other provinces had matched and even
surpased their incidence rates, including Segovia and Soria to the north
of Madrid, and Ciudad Real and Albacete to the south.

Figure  shows the distribution of the environmental variables in Spain.
For ease of visualization we aggregate the provinces by Autonomous
Community. Each box-and-whisker in the figure represents the
distribution of the variable for a community over the 30-day period. In
the plot, the communities have been sorted by latitude, so that
Principado de Asturias is the northernmost community, and Andalucia the
southernmost. As seen in the figure, there is a relatively wide range of
values both within and between provinces over the 30-day period
examined. The top panel of the figure shows the distribution of mean
temperatures. The lowest mean temperature for a community on any given
day was approximately 3°C, and the highest about 20°C, for a range of
approximately 17 degrees. Likewise, there is a great deal of variability
in humidity, as seen in the middle panel of the figure, where the lowest
mean humidity for any community is approximately 48% and the highest is
close to 100%. Finally, the bottom panel displays mean daily hours of
sunshine in the community. This variable displays the most variability
within communities over time, but remains relatively constant across
communities. It is important to note that these are summaries by
community, and the actual values of these variables for the provinces
display somewhat more variability.

Communities in Spain between March 12, 2020 and April 11, 2020. The

southernmost](README_files/figure-gfm/descriptives-temperature-1.png)

Figure  includes three maps that display the spatial variation of our
control variables, namely GDP per capita, percentage of older adults in
province, population density, and presence of mass transit systems. As
seen there, GDP per capita is higher in Madrid and the northeast part of
the country, mainly in Pais Vasco and Cataluña. Percentage of older
adults is somewhat more checkered, with high values in Madrid and other
provinces in the center-west part of the country, but also in some
provinces in the north. Outside of provinces with major cities (e.g.,
Madrid; Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa in Pais Vasco; Pontevedra in Galicia),
population density tends to be higher in provinces along the
Mediterranean coast. The final panel in the figure shows the five
provinces in the country that have higher order mass transit systems
(e.g., metro).

province](README_files/figure-gfm/map-controls-1.png)

Figure  shows the distribution of daily simple correlations of incidence
of COVID-19 with the independent variables (with the exception of
Transit, which is a categorical variable). These correlations are
calculated after log-transforming all variables. As previously
discussed, the environmental variables have a temporal lag and were
calculated using different time windows.

It can be seen in the figure that temperature (in its three forms) has
the highest simple correlation with incidence of COVID-19. After
temperature, GDP per capita has the highest positive correlation with
the dependent variable. The distribution of these correlations is also
quite tight over the 30-day period of the study. Hours of sunshine tends
to have a moderately high correlation with incidence of COVID-19, but
the distribution of these correlations is more spread, and in some cases
strays into negative values. A similar thing happens with humidity,
which also tends to display more day to day variation in the correlation
with the dependent variable. The percentage of older adults shows a
relatively tight distribution of day-to-day correlations, and is
negative. Population density, in contrast, tends to be negative, but is
relatively spread, and on some days, the simple correlation between
density and incidence of COVID-19 is weakly positive. Overall for the
period under examination, the pairwise correlations between these
variables and incidence are significant at \(p<0.05\), with the
exception of the three Sunshine\_hours variables.

daily incidence of COVID-19 (all variables have been
log-transformed)](README_files/figure-gfm/daily-correlations-1.png)

## SUR Models

Correlation analysis in the preceding section provides some insights
about the potential associations between incidence of COVID-19 and the
various environmental and control variables. In this section we estimate
three spatial SUR models to test the differences between the various
temporal lags and weighting schemes for the environmental variables.
Accordingly, we define three models: Model 1, which is estimated using
the lagged 8-day averages of the environmental variables (*lag8*); Model
2, which is estimated using the lagged 11-day averages of the
environmental variables (*lag11*); and finally, Model 3, which is
estimated using the lagged 11-day *weighted* averages of the
environmental variables (*lag11w*).

To implement the SUR approach, we must define a matrix of spatial
weights \(W\). In this case, we consider neighborhoods based on
adjacency, based on the well-known queen criterion (two provinces are
adjacent if they share a boundary or touch at a vertex). The analysis is
of the coterminous provinces.

For estimation, we log-transform the dependent and quantitative
independent variables. The only variable that is not transformed is the
categorical variable for transit systems. A log-log transformation is
appropriate to capture non-linear relationships between variables and
provides a straightforward interpretation of the coefficients as
percentage change. Furthermore, we introduce restrictions so that the
coefficients of two of our control variables are constant over time,
namely GDP per capita and percentage of older adults. We do not see an
*a priori* reason to let those two variables vary across equations, and
the correlation analysis in Figure  also suggest little temporal
variation. In contrast, we let the spatial autocorrelation parameter, as
well as the parameters of the rest of the independent variables
(including the constant) to vary over time. This will be useful to
detect whether there are behavioral adaptations at the population level
over the course of the period examined. As an example of behavioral
adaptations, the effect of density might weaken over time, in the
measure that the effects of the lockdown are felt: at full compliance
with the lockdown, with people practicing social avoidance, density
might matter less than other factors.

After estimation, we compare the goodness of fit of the three SUR
models. Figure  shows the equation-level coefficient of determination
\(R^2\), one for each time period/day. As well, the overall coefficient
of determination for the system is reported for each model
\(\text{pooled}-R^2\). The general trend is identical for the three
models, with the goodness-of-fit improving over time and plateuing
around a value of \(R^2\) of 0.55. Model 1 (*lag8*) performs somewhat
better in the first few equations/days, when the goodness-of-fit is
relatively poor, and then again in the last few equations/days. Model 3
(*lag11w*), in contrast, does not perform well towards the end of the
study period. The most balanced model in terms of equation-level
goodness-of-fit appears to be Model 1 (*lag8*), and this impression is
further supported by a slightly higher value of the
\(\text{pooled}-R^2\). The analysis using a lagged moving average of the
environmental variables is generally in line with the incubation period
reported by Lauer et al. (2020), although the results do not support the
use of a weighted average. For the remainder of the paper, we will adopt
Model 1 (*lag8*) as our best model. In the following section we discuss
the results of the analysis in more depth.

![ Goodness of fit of the SUR systems: by date and
pooled](README_files/figure-gfm/goodness-of-fit-1.png)

# Discussion

Table  presents a summary of the results of Model 1 (*lag8*). Recall
that two coefficients were constrained and are estimated only for the
first equation of the system, and thus are assumed to be constant over
time. These are the coefficients corresponding to GDP per capita
(\(p\leq0.10\)) and percentage of older adults (\(p\leq0.05\)). The sign
of the coefficient for GDP per capita is positive, which indicates that
wealthier regions tend to have a higher incidence of COVID-19. This is
in line with the idea that the epidemic started earlier in wealthier
places due to their connections to a globalized world. The sign of the
coefficient for percentage of older adults, on the other hand, is
negative. As previously discussed, the level of social contact of older
adults even under normal circumstances tends to be lower than for
younger people. As a consequence, places with larger populations of
older adults appear to have a natural level of social distancing in
place. It is important to note that this does not detract from evidence
that older adults are more vulnerable individually and in institutional
settings, where their case mortality rates are perhaps the highest of
all age groups. Instead, this result indicates that their presence in
the community at large tends to depress transmission of the virus.

Of the two other control variables, the coefficient of population
density is significant at \(p\leq0.05\) in 12, at \(p\leq0.10\) in 3
equations, and not significant in 15. The coefficient for transit is
significant at \(p\leq0.10\) in 20 equations, and of those, significant
at \(p\leq0.05\) in 18 equations. The next four variables are
environmental factors. The coefficient for humidity is significant at
\(p\leq0.19\) in 20 equations, and of those, significant at
\(p\leq0.05\) in 15 equations. Of the environmental variables,
temperature is the only variable that has significant coefficients in
every equation at \(p\leq0.05\). Finally, sunshine has significant
coefficients at \(p\leq0.05\) in 24 equations.

To better understand the results, we proceed to plot the coefficients in
their temporal sequence. At this point it is worth recalling that the
state of emergency went into effect on March 14. In the following
figures, the periods of time indicated in yellow starting on March 14
correspond to the state of emergency, with only essential travel and
selected industrial activities allowed; the period of time in orange was
the stricter lockdown when only essential travel was allowed.

We begin our discussion with the evolution of the spatial
autocorrelation coefficient (\(\rho\)) in Figure  (left panel). We
notice that the magnitude of the spatial autocorrelation coefficient
\(\rho\) declines over the period under analysis, and is not significant
for some days. This is an interesting result: immediately prior to the
declaration of the state of emergency, there appears to have been a
strong inter-provincial contagion effect. Keeping in mind that the
incubation period ranges between 2 and 12 days with a median of 5, it is
reasonable to expect that the effect of the lockdown will be observed
with some delay. Indeed, as seen in the figure, the autocorrelation
coefficient remains high for several days, then begins to decline around
March 23, and continues to weaken over time. At the end of the period
under examination, the strength of this effect is much diminished and we
would expect that under full compliance with strict lockdown conditions
(meaning no inter-provincial mobility) the spatial contagion effect
would be zero - as seems to be the case.

The intercept (right panel in Figure ) is indicative of the variation of
the incidence of COVID-19, other things being equal. Here we see that at
the incidence declines somewhat immediately after the state of
emergency, only to begin increasing again over time. Then, the incidence
declines again after the stricter lockdown and rebounds to a lower level
by April 11.

after the declaration of the state of emergency, and in orange is the
period when only essential activities were
allowed.](README_files/figure-gfm/results-time-1-1.png)

Figure  shows the temporal evolution of the coefficients for the two
control variables that were not fixed over time, i.e., \(\log(Density)\)
(left panel) and \(Transit\) (right panel).

In Section  we had anticipated a positive sign for the coefficient of
density, and indeed, at the beginning of the period the coefficient is
positive, albeit not significant, and then remains mostly
non-significant for the earlier part of the lockdown. We are somewhat
surprised by the way this coefficient turns significant *and* negative
in the later part of the lockdown, after April 1st. This effect, we
surmise, is the result of risk compensation, a situation where people
adapt their behavior according to the *perceived* level of risk,
becoming more careful when the perceived risk is higher and viceversa
(e.g., Noland 1995; Richens, Imrie, and Copas 2000; Phillips, Fyhri, and
Sagberg 2011). Consequently, residents in high density regions may
perceive the risk of infection as being higher, and adapt their behavior
accordingly - while the opposite may be true of residents in low density
regions. The coefficient for Transit is positive, as expected, but with
very wide confidence intervals, and in fact not significant in the
earlier part of the period.

yellow is the period after the declaration of the state of emergency,
and in orange is the period when only essential activities were

The evolution of the coefficients for the three environmental variables
is shown in Figure . Despite a mostly positive simple correlation with
incidence (see Figure ) once that we control for other factors, humidity
has a negative association with incidence of COVID-19 in Spain
(top-right panel). This is in line with the literature that describes
the lower viability and transmission of different viruses at higher
levels of humidity. The coefficients for temperature (top-right panel)
are consistently negative and this variable is, besides the intercept,
the only one with significant coefficients in all equations. The range
of variation of this coefficient during the period examined is
approximately between -1 and -2, although it is important to recall that
these values should not be interpreted directly as effects; more on this
below. Finally the plot for the coefficients associated with hours of
sunshine (bottom panel) is more ambiguous: prior to the lockdown, the
coefficient was negative, but not significant. However, five days into
the lockdown, the coefficient becomes significant and *positive*. This
result stands in contrast to previous findings regarding influenza,
where more hours of sunlight reduced the strength and duration of
epidemic durations (Yu et al. 2013). A difference with previous studies
is the temporal scale of the analysis: where Yu et al. (2013) use
monthly averages, we use daily data for a much shorter period of time.
The positive sign of sunshine may well be another instance of behavioral
adaptations, whereby compliance with lockdown orders weakens on sunny
days.

The preceding discussion helps to establish the inferential
contributions of the analysis, and indicate which variables display
significant statistical associations with incidence of COVID-19. The
remaining question is, what are the implications.

As discussed in Section  the effect of a variable is not clear from its
coefficient alone, since a change to a variable in a province
influences, via the contagion effect, its neighbors. For this reason,
the appropriate way to estimate the effects is to calculate both the own
effect and the effect due to contagion, or in other words the direct and
indirect effects, respectively. The total effect is the sum of the two.
A summary of the effects appears in Table . All effects in the table are
interpreted as percentage change in the incidence of COVID-19 as a
consequence of a one percent change in the variable. The exception to
this is Transit (which was not log-transformed). This variable instead
represents the percentage change in incidence between provinces without
and with mass transit systems.

Two variables had temporally constrained coefficients. The estimated
effect of GDP per capita is to increase the incidence of COVID-19 by
0.449% for each percent increase of this variable (in €1,000s). In our
view, this is a measure of inertia, as provinces with higher GDP per
capita where among the first to see exponential growth in the pandemic.
Percentage of older adults has a negative effect, and each percent
increase in this variable is associated with a relatively small
reduction of the incidence of approximately 0.67%.

The temporal variation of the effects for the rest of the variables is
shown in Figure . The largest positive direct effect is Transit, and the
largest direct negative effects are temperature and humidity. The direct
effects of these variables are as follows: for each percent point
increase in temperature, there is between a 1% and 2% reduction in the
incidence of the disease. This effect is compounded via contagion, as
seen in the central panel in the figure, and the indirect effect can
further reduce the incidence by up to 0.75%. The effect of humidity is
also to reduce the incidence: each percent point of increase in humidity
is associated with a reduction of up to 2% in incidence. With the
addition of the indirect effect, the total effect of a 1% increase in
humidity is to reduce incidence by up to 3%. As seen in the figure, the
indirect (i.e., contagion) effects are stronger at the before and at the
beginning of the lockdown period. Nonetheless, by the end of the period
under study, the indirect effects have weakened considerably.

What do these effects mean? Under a situation of lockdown,
inter-regional contagion is reduced, as expected, and the total effects
of the variables tend towards their direct effects. In the first few
days covered by our analysis the total effect of all variables is
greater due to the spatial contagion effect. Contagion makes analysis
and intervention more complex: the contagion effect essentially acts
like a multiplier, whereby developments in each province spill over to
their neighbors. Once the contagion effect has been tamed, each province
can be “treated” independently from its neighbors.

It is important, before concluding our discussion, to highlight some
limitations of this study.

First, the analysis was conducted mostly under a situation of lockdown,
and therefore, besides first days of the period examined, one must
exercise caution when trying to extrapolate the findings to a situations
without lockdown. Secondly, it is well known that there is in many
countries substantial underreporting of cases of COVID-19 due to limited
testing. In this case we do not suspect systematic provincial bias in
reporting, and as long as the underreporting is consistent across units
of analysis, we do not expect biased results; it is still important,
however, to remain aware that the number of true cases is likely higher.
Finally, we defined neighborhoods based on adjacency. It would be
interesting to compare adjacency to other connectivity criteria, for
instance based on domestic transportation instrastructure and services.
We flag this as a matter for future research.

# Concluding Remarks

In this paper we presented a spatio-temporal analysis of incidence of
COVID-19 in Spain. The analysis covers a 30-day period that begins
immediately before the state of emergency was declared in the country.
The focus of the research has been on the environmental correlates of
incidence of the disease. There is a need for more empirical evidence,
as policy makers, public health practitioners, and the public begin
planning for the months ahead at this early stage of the pandemic.

Our results offer strong support for the hypothesis that incidence of
COVID-19 at the population level is lower at higher temperatures and
levels of humidity: the estimated effect is a reduction in the
neighborhood of 3% percent in incidence per each 1% increase in
temperature, and a 3% reduction in incidence per 1% increase in humidity
*under conditions of contagion*. These reductions are lower when
contagion has ceased (i.e., due to lockdown conditions). The question
here seems to be whether these environmental variables can yield a
bigger reduction of *more* cases, or a smaller reduction of *fewer*
cases.

Our control variables also offer some interesting insights. In
particular, there is evidence of behavioral adaptations during lockdown
in the form of risk compensation (density) and compliance with the
lockdown (sunshine). These results offer a cautionary tale with regards
to the effectiveness of the lockdown in more dense areas, and also the
implications for compliance with stay-at-home orders as the northern
hemisphere moves towards summer and more hours of sunshine during the
day. If risk compensation is a factor, then efforts should be made to
reduce or eliminate risk compensation in less densely populated regions.

A key aspect of the analysis using spatial SUR models is that we were
able to model incidence of COVID-19 as an interregional contagion
process. Here, we find that the strength of the contagion effect was
dramatically reduced by the lockdown.

Needless to say, the analysis presented here is at the level of
population health. For this reason, the analysis does not make any
claims with respect to the effect of ultraviolet light on the virus, but
rather about transmission of the virus in the population. For example,
the analysis does not imply that the virus moves less effectively in
places where more people live in close proximity to each other, but
rather that humans are more contagious when they feel safe in less dense
regions. Similarly, more sunshine does not mean that the virus thrives,
but rather that humans are more contagious to each other when their
behavior adapts to this environmental condition.

Some directions for future research include investigating other
modelling frameworks, such as geographically and temporally weighted
regression and/or space-time conditional autoregressive models. In
addition, the environmental variables examined here relate to
meteorological conditions only, and did not include other environmental
factors that may incide in the transmission of the virus, such as
pollution. These other factors should be incorporated in future studies.
